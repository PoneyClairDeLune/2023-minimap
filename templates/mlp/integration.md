## Diplomatic contacts
Please join our Discord server: https://discord.gg/bronyplace

There is a diplomacy chat along with a forum for diplomats and allies.

## Getting our art
We offer an osu!/Endu-style template at https://ponyplace.z19.web.core.windows.net/endu_template.json which only contains art from our faction.
We make updates to this template alongside our internal formats as we push changes out.

Please contact our diplomats (or go ruffling around in GitHub) if you need specific pieces of art or have a different request.

## Adding new art
Before you contact a diplomat, please have your art ready.
We are capable of accepting [osu!/Endu-style templates](https://github.com/osuplace/templateManager) but do not follow the whitelist references, nor do we support animation.
We are also capable of accepting 1:1 / "one pixel per pixel" .png images with transparency and the appropriate coordinates of the upper left corner of the image.

We do not accept images that are not 1:1, or are not transparent. We ask that your images only contain colors that the canvas currently supports.

Once you have this, please contact a diplomat to get it entered into our [processing queue.](https://github.com/orgs/r-ainbowroad/projects/2/views/1)

## Updating your art
If you provided your art as an image, please contact the diplomats to get the updated version into our [processing queue.](https://github.com/orgs/r-ainbowroad/projects/2/views/1)

If you provided your art in an osu!/Endu-style template, it will get picked up automatically eventually.
We appreciate notice of big changes, and you can ask us to force refresh if a change needs to happen faster.
